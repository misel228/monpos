A tool to pixel perfectly position monitors on a Windows desktop.

If you have a Windows machine with more than one row of monitors you might have noticed that the Windows monitor alignment tool doesn't snap them on the corners properly.

-- insert screenshot here --

This tool aims to change this. The intended workflow is to 
1. roughly align the monitors with Windows native solution,
2. run this program once, to generate a monitor map file
3. use a text editor to change the alignment as wanted in the map file
4. run the program again with the updated map file to finally set your monitors
